**Today's Progress**: Decided to create slack bot that when called will tell you who is on-call for our team.

**Thoughts**: Forced learning is fun. Can't get slack bot to respond. Need to explore the api more and solve it.

**Today's Progress**: Slack bot is on hold temporarily whilst I read through the Slack API to find out why it's not
working as it should. Today I've worked on a PyBite challenge "Find the most common word" where I need to write a function
to find the most common word in a Harry Potter text file.

**Thoughts**: I'm familiar with how to write and call a function but working with files in addition to stripping out
non-alphanumeric characters is new and not entirely intuitive to me. This is labeled as easy but it's difficult. This
also required a lot of work with list comprehensions but I managed.
