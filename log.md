# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Decided to create slack bot that when called will tell you who is on-call for our team.

**Thoughts**: Forced learning is fun. Can't get slack bot to respond. Need to explore the api more and solve it.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Slack bot is on hold temporarily whilst I read through the Slack API to find out why it's not
working as it should. Today I've worked on a PyBite challenge "Find the most common word" where I need to write a function
to find the most common word in a Harry Potter text file.

**Thoughts**: I'm familiar with how to write and call a function but working with files in addition to stripping out
non-alphanumeric characters is new and not entirely intuitive to me. This is labeled as easy but it's difficult. This
also required a lot of work with list comprehensions but I managed.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Finished the PyBite challenge from yesterday. Quite the ordeal but I learned a lot from it. Started
on a new PyBites challenge, "Query a nested data structure" which involves getting info from a dict using keys and values.

**Thoughts**: This one is as hard as the previous. Introduction to sorting dictionaries and lambda.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Finished the PyBite challenge from yesterday. Having done extensive list comprehensions the previous day helped.
Today I'm working on another PyBite, "Write a simple property". It took me almost all day but I managed to complete it successfully.

**Thoughts**: This was very difficult as I've never worked with classes before. This also incorporated a dunder method, the datetime library,
and property decorators. All new to me but I finished the challenge and learned a lot.

### Day 5: January 6, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Updated my Day-02 code to make it more pythonic. Specifically, a better way to open and auto close files using "with". I
also started work on my first intermediate level PyBite.

**Thoughts**: This was very difficult as I've never worked with claasses before. This also incorporated a dunder method, the datetime library,
and property decorators. All new to me but I finished the challenge and learned a lot.

### Day 6: January 7, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Completed the day 5 challenge. Solved it with itertools combination and permutation. Today was more
relaxed as it's a weekend and tomorrow is my birthday. I could have solved this sooner if I'd have tried.

**Thoughts**: This was easier than some of the beginner bites. It helped when I realized I didn't know the difference between
a combination and permutation. This was key to solving the problem.

### Day 7: January 8, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Today's challenge is about raising exceptions and value errors.

**Thoughts**: This was more difficult than I anticipated. I first tried to nest multiple 'except' statements in a single try
but it seems to be easier to make if/elif chain and raise the exceptions within. Also learned to use a math function
to find out if a variable is a number or not.

### Day 8: January 9, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Learning about collections modules in today's bite.

**Thoughts**: Lack od documentation has hurt my progress. I know I need to combine regular expression methods and
methods from the collections library too.

### Day 9: January 10, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Work completed on the previous day's problem. Starting work on a new bite of py.

**Thoughts**: The key to yesterday's challenge was understanding what 'TAG_HTML' did.

### Day 11: January 12, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Figured out the nested loops/conditionals I needed to find the highes score of a word in a
given list which completed the pybite challenge!

**Thoughts**: The looping in the 3rd function is what took so long. Things have to be done in order for it to work right
but I figured it out.

### Day 12: January 13, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Busy day so I read the docs on what __init__.py is and what it's used for. These files make python
treat the directories as containing packages.

**Thoughts**:

### Day 14: January 15, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Began work on another pybite. This one is about reading in a csv file and extracting data.

**Thoughts**: Never worked with csv files before. This will be a learning experience.

### Day 15: January 16, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Work continues on PyBite #30

**Thoughts**:

* [Python Docs: Collections: NamedTuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple)
* [Python Docs: DefaultDict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)

**Link to work**:[PyBites: Word Values](https://codechalleng.es/bites/30/)

### Day 16: January 17, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Work continues on PyBite #30. Managed to get the info out of the csv and into a list. Now I need
to get it into a dict and formatted correctly. This is all brand new to me whereas the previous intermediate challenges
built on things I had either seen before or were in the beginner challenges. This is both frustrating and interesting.

**Thoughts**: Found another article that helped me understand default dict better. Ordered the book the info came from.

**Link to work**:[PyBites: Word Values](https://codechalleng.es/bites/30/)

### Day 17: January 18, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to extract the data from the csv file. Still unsure how to use the defaultdict,
namedyuple in all of this to formate the data.

**Thoughts**: This is more difficult than I'd imagined.

**Link to work**:[PyBites: Word Values](https://codechalleng.es/bites/30/)

### Day 18: January 19, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Gave up on the previous bybite and viewed the solution. I was on the rigth path but fundamentally
unaware of how to use the default dict and namedtuple correctly despite reading articles, stackoverflow and the python docs.
Started the pybites blog challenges. The first one was the scrabble "bite of py" challenge so that was an easy copypasta.

**Thoughts**: I was able to understand the solution and how to finally use these two things correctly. That aside there is a
part of the code that, in order for it to work correctly, needs to have a try/except clause in it for some reason. I asked
Bob Belderbos about this and while he said he's not 100% certain why it works he believes it has something to do with the way
the data is formatted.

### Day 19: January 20, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the second pybites blog challenge. This one isn't csv/namedtuple difficult but it does
require me to pass information between functions which is new to me.

**Thoughts**: Ordering the python 3 std lib book has been very helpful.

### Day 20: January 21, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Sorted out another two of the functions in the second pybites blog challenge. Ran into a problem with
one of the functions that calculates scores. Made notes on what is failing. Will investigate. Also read another chapter in
Grokking Algorithims.

**Thoughts**: Good progress today. Feeling good. I believe that with the last failed bite of py I finally hit a limit on the
amount learned in such a short amount of time. I'm not going back to basics but I am shifting focus on building what I've
learned so far rather than pushing forward with a not totally solid understanding.

### Day 21: January 22, 2018


**Today's Progress**:

**Thoughts**: Still working on challenge #2. I know what needs to be done with this specific function it's just a matter
of getting the loops to iterater over the right stuff properly AND return the nexeccary information.

### Days 22-37 January 23, 2018 through February 7, 2018


**Progress**: Finished challenge #2, 3 and 4. Being stuck on Classes is a big indicator that I still have lots of work to do.
Starting work on another bite of py.

**Thoughts**: Need to look for exercises with classes.

### Day 43 February 13, 2018


**Progress**: Finished my password generator. It takes 2 random words in that 236k dictionary, randomly capitalizes letters
in the word and adds in random chars and numbers then prints out 5 random ones to my cli.

**Thoughts**: Randomizing the things was the most difficult part.

### Day 44 February 14, 2018


**Progress**: Taking a break from the password gen feature adds to work on a bite of py. This one is about writing a decorator
to wrap text in one or more html tags.

**Thoughts**: This wasn't easy. Need more experience with them.

### Day 45 February 15, 2018


**Progress**: Finished the decorator bite. Subscriptions for pybites opened and I subbed. Started on the beginner ones. This
is about *args and **kwargs.

**Thoughts**: This one was easy except the formatting is being difficult and failing tests.

### Day 46-47 February 16-20, 2018


**Progress**: Figured out the output formatting of the args/kwargs problem. Starting on a new bite about dict comprehensions.

**Thoughts**: Not much different than list comprehensions.
