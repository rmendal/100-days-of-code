# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Decided to create slack bot that when called will tell you who is on-call for our team.

**Thoughts**: Forced learning is fun. Can't get slack bot to respond. Need to explore the api more and solve it.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Slack bot is on hold temporarily whilst I read through the Slack API to find out why it's not
working as it should. Today I've worked on a PyBite challenge "Find the most common word" where I need to write a function
to find the most common word in a Harry Potter text file.

**Thoughts**: I'm familiar with how to write and call a function but working with files in addition to stripping out
non-alphanumeric characters is new and not entirely intuitive to me. This is labeled as easy but it's difficult. This
also required a lot of work with list comprehensions but I managed.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Finished the PyBite challenge from yesterday. Quite the ordeal but I learned a lot from it. Started
on a new PyBites challenge, "Query a nested data structure" which involves getting info from a dict using keys and values.

**Thoughts**: This one is as hard as the previous. Introduction to sorting dictionaries and lambda.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Finished the PyBite challenge from yesterday. Having done extensive list comprehensions the previous day helped.
Today I'm working on another PyBite, "Write a simple property". It took me almost all day but I managed to complete it successfully.

**Thoughts**: This was very difficult as I've never worked with classes before. This also incorporated a dunder method, the datetime library,
and property decorators. All new to me but I finished the challenge and learned a lot.

### Day 5: January 6, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Updated my Day-02 code to make it more pythonic. Specifically, a better way to open and auto close files using "with". I
also started work on my first intermediate level PyBite.

**Thoughts**: This was very difficult as I've never worked with claasses before. This also incorporated a dunder method, the datetime library,
and property decorators. All new to me but I finished the challenge and learned a lot.

### Day 6: January 7, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Completed the day 5 challenge. Solved it with itertools combination and permutation. Today was more
relaxed as it's a weekend and tomorrow is my birthday. I could have solved this sooner if I'd have tried.

**Thoughts**: This was easier than some of the beginner bites. It helped when I realized I didn't know the difference between
a combination and permutation. This was key to solving the problem.

### Day 7: January 8, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Today's challenge is about raising exceptions and value errors.

**Thoughts**: This was more difficult than I anticipated. I first tried to nest multiple 'except' statements in a single try
but it seems to be easier to make if/elif chain and raise the exceptions within. Also learned to use a math function
to find out if a variable is a number or not.
