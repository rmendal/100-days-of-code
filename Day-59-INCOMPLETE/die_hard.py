Given a listing of files of our community branch determine who PR'd (= submitted pull request) the most
(excluding PyBites) and what challenge is the most popular (PR'd) as per snapshot of today (8th of Dec 2017).

See preparation done in the code template below. Replace pass with your code to make the test pass. Good luck and have
fun!
